1. Course Schedule: There are total of numCourses labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1. A list of prerequisites is given in which each element is a pair of integers, the first integer being the course and the second being its prerequisite. The objective is to find if all the courses can be completed. 

2. Course Schedule: There are total of numCourses labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1. A list of prerequisites is given in which each element is a pair of integers, the first integer being the course and the second being its prerequisite. The objective is to find the order in which the courses should be completed to complete all courses. 

3. Maximal Network Rank: There is an infrastructure of n cities with some number of roads connecting these cities. Each roads[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is a bidirectional road between the cities ai and bi. The network rank of two different cities is defined as the total number of directly connected roads to either city. The maximal network rank of the infrastructure is the maximum network rank of all pairs of different cities. Given integer n and array of roads, the objective is to find the maximal network rank of the entire infrastructure.
