1. Range Sum BST: Given a binary search tree, the objective is to find the sum of the node values between low and high values.

2. Increasing Order Search Tree: Given the root of a binary search tree, the objective is to rearrange the tree such that the leftmost node is the root and every node has only right child. 

3. Surrounded Regions: Given a 2D board containing 'X' and 'O's, the objective is to flip all 'O's int surrounded regions to 'X's. Any 'O' that is not on the border and is not connected to the 'O's on the border will be flipped. 

4. House Robber III: Different houses are linked to each other forming a binary tree. A thief decides to rob the houses, but has a few constraints. The thief can rob either the current house and its grand children or its children since robbing two directly linked houses automatically sets off a call to the police. The objective is to rob houses in such a way that the profit is maximum.

5. Max Area of Island: Given a non empty 2D array of 0s and 1s where 0s correspond to regions where there is water and 1s correspond to regions of land. The objective is to find the maximum area of a connected region of land. 

6. Number of Islands: Given a m x n 2D grid of 1s and 0s where 1s correspond to land and 0s correspond to water. An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. The objective is to find the number of islands in the grid. 

7. Longest Increasing Path in a Matrix: Given an m x n matrix, the objective is to return the length of the longest increasing path in the matrix. 

8. Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum: A path is a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in the sequence at most once. The path sum of a path is sum of nodes values in the path. The objective is to find the maximum path sum. 

9. Matchsticks to Square: Given a list of numbers representing the length of different matchsticks, the objective is to find whether they can be arranged to form a square. 

10. Clone Graph: Given a reference node in a connected undirected graph, the objective is to return a deep copy of the graph.
