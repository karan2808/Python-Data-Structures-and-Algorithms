1. Word Ladder Problem: The objective is to find the minimum number of transformations required from start word to end word, one letter at a time. Each transformed word has to be present in the provided dictionary of words. We use breadth first search to traverse level by level, enumerating all possible variations of a word by changing one letter at a time.

2. Clone Graph: Given a reference node in a connected undirected graph, the objective is to return a deep copy of the graph.
