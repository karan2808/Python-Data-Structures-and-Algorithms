1. Path With Minimum Effort: A hiker preparing for an upcoming hike is given heights, a 2D array of size rows x columns, where heights[row][col] represents the height of cell (row, col). The hiker starts at top left cell (0, 0) and travels down to the bottom right cell (rows - 1, cols - 1). The hiker can move up, down, left or right and the objective is to find the route that takes minimum effort. A route's effort is the maximum absolute difference in heights between two consecutive cells of the route.
