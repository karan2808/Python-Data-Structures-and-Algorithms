1. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock: Given an array of prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

2. Longest Palindromic Substring: Given a string s, the goal is to find the longest palindromic substring in s.

3. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Cooldown: Given an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i. The objective is to find a maximum profit given that multiple transactions are not allowed, meaning a stock has to be sold before buying it again and after selling the stock, it cannot be bought on the next day.

4. Regular Expression Matching: Given two strings the task is to implement a regular expression matching with support for '.' and '*' where '.' can match any character and '*' can match zero or more of the preceeding element.

5. Maximum Subarray Sum: Given an array, the task is to find the maximum sum of a contiguous sub array. 

6. Unique Paths: A robot is located at top left corner of an m x n grid. It can only move right or down. Objective is to find the number of ways to reach the bottom right corner of the grid.

7. Decode Ways: A message containing letters A - Z can be encoded into numbers from 1-26, we need to find number of ways to decode this string. 

8. Unique Paths 2: A robot is located at top left corner of an m x n grid. It can only more right or down. The Objective is to find number of ways to reach the bottom right corner of the grid while avoiding obstacles. 

9. CanIWin: Two players play a game. Each takes turn and selects a number from 1 to maxChoosableInteger. The first one to cross the desiredTotal sum wins. Each number can only be selected once. If a player plays first, the objective is to find if that player can force a win if both players play optimally.

10. Mininum Path Sum: Given a m x n grid, a robot starts at top left. The objective is to find the minimum path sum from top left to bottom right if the robot can move only right or down. 

11. Coin Change: Given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money 'amount'. The objective is to find the maximum amount of coins that are needed to make up that total 'amount'. There are infinite number of each kind of coin.

12. Coin Change 2: Given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money 'amount'. The objective is to find the number of combinations of coins that can sum to 'amount'.

13. Unique Binary Search Trees: Given an integer n, the objective is to find the total number of structurally unique BSTs (Binary Search Trees) which have exactly n nodes of unique values from 1 to n. 

14. Climbing Stairs: Given a stair case of n steps, you can climb either 1 or 2 steps at a time. Find number of distinct ways to climb the top.
