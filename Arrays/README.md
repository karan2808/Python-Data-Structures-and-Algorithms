1. Design a Stack with Increment Operation: The objective is to design a custom stack of a given maximum size that supports push, pop and increment operations. Push adds an element to the top of the stack, if the stak has not reached max size. Pop removes and retrieves an element from the top of the stack. Increment increments the bottom k elements of the stack by a given value. 

2. First Missing Positive: Given an integer array, find the smallest missing positive number.

3. Pivot Index: Given an integer array, find the pivot index i such that the sum over all elements at indices less than i is equal to the sum over all elements with indices greater than i.

4. Partition Equal Subset Sum: Given a non-empty array nums containing only positive integers, the objective is to find if the array can be partitioned into subsets of equal sum.
